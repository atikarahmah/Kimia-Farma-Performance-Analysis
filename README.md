# Kimia Farma Performance Analysis
🟦 Overview

This project aimed to analyze Kimia Farma’s business performance from 2020 to 2023 across multiple branches, provinces, and product categories. The dashboard delivers interactive insights to assist stakeholders in evaluating sales trends, branch profitability, top products, and customer satisfaction.

📘 Project Background

In large-scale healthcare and pharmaceutical businesses like Kimia Farma, monitoring operational and financial performance across numerous branches, provinces, and product categories poses a significant challenge. With thousands of transactions occurring across clinics, pharmacies, and laboratories nationwide, decision-makers require a centralized view to evaluate business performance efficiently.

This project was initiated to analyze Kimia Farma’s business performance from 2020 to 2023, consolidating key indicators such as total revenue, transaction volume, net profit, branch ratings, product contribution, and regional profitability into a single interactive Power BI dashboard.

The goal was to generate data-driven insights that would enable management to identify top-performing regions, evaluate product success, monitor year-over-year revenue trends, and optimize strategic planning across branch types and geographies.

🧩 Project Summary

🟥 Problem Statement

The management lacked a visual, consolidated way to monitor province-level performance, top product contribution, and year-over-year revenue trends. This made it difficult to identify declining branches, shifting product demand, and underperforming areas in a timely manner.

🎯 Objective
1. Monitor total sales, transactions, and net profit across four years (2020–2023)
2. Identify top-performing products and regions
3. Analyze revenue trends and customer satisfaction metrics
4. Provide actionable recommendations to improve profitability and operational efficiency

🛠 Tools & Dataset

Tools: Power BI

Dataset: Internal business records from 2020–2023 containing:
1. Sales transactions
2. Net revenue
3. Product categories
4. Provincial branch data
5. Ratings (branch vs transaction)
6. Geographical distribution

🔄 Methodology / Workflow
1. Data Import & Cleaning = Imported structured data into Power BI and ensured quality control for metrics like sales, profit, and region codes.
2. Data Modeling = Connected transactional data with product and location dimensions.
3. Dashboard Design
   Created visual components for:
   - Revenue & profit by year
   - Branch transactions & ratings
   - Product performance
   - Regional profitability via map
   - Comparison of branch types
4. Insight Generation = Identified high-performing categories, peak revenue periods, and branch-level strengths/weaknesses.

📈 Key Findings / Insights
1. Total Revenue: 347.0B | Net Profit: 98.5B | Transactions: 672.5K
2. Jawa Barat led all provinces in sales and transactions (41.7%)
3. Top products include Psycholeptics (Hypnotics, Anxiolytics), accounting for over 116B in net sales
4. Revenue peaked in 2022, but dropped again in 2023, signaling volatility
5. Kimia Farma – Klinik & Apotek earned the highest branch rating

💡 Recommendations
1. Prioritize inventory, marketing, and expansion in high-performing regions like Jawa Barat
2. Re-evaluate performance in low-profit provinces and identify localized barriers
3. Focus on top-selling product categories (e.g., Psycholeptics) for demand planning and bundling
4. Investigate the revenue drop in 2021 and 2023 to identify operational bottlenecks
5. Improve transaction satisfaction ratings through staff training and service quality improvement
